When viewing an order in the admin area, you'll find a "Copy Payment Link" button in the order actions sidebar. Click this button to copy the payment URL to your clipboard, which you can then share with your customer.

Customers can modify pending orders by adding or removing products, changing item quantities (with stock validation), selecting different shipping methods, and adding special instructions. All changes are calculated in real-time with updated totals and shipping costs.
